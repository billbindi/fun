This is just a repo for some fun projects that I work on.

game.py & game27.py - A fun experiment of the 3n + 1 game where given a number, n, perform these steps:
                                    1) if n = 1 stop
                                    2) if n even, divide by 2
                                    3) if n odd, triple and add 1
                      It is conjectured that any input will always terminate. I have no intention to try to prove it, but it is a fun problem nonetheless.
                      The game27 exists because of syntax changes in python 3.0 and above (mainly dealing with print).
